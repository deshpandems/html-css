        Note that in order to manipulate elements in the DOM using JavaScript, the JavaScript code must be run after the
        relevant element has been created in the document. This can be achieved by putting the JavaScript tags
        after all of your other content. Alternatively, you can also use an event listener to listen to eg. window's
        onload event, adding your code to that event listener will delay running your code until after the whole content on
        your page has been loaded.Note that in order to manipulate elements in the DOM using JavaScript, the JavaScript code must be run after the
