      Note that in order to manipulate elements in DOM using JavaScript, the JavaScript code must be run after the
      relevant element has been created in the document. This can be achieved by putting the JavaScript script tags
      after all of your other body content. Alternatively, you can also use an event listener to listen to eg. window's
      onload event, adding your code to that event listener will delay running your code until after the whole content on
      your page has been loaded.
